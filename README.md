### At first, I decided to work on Arch Linux for my laptop in my spare time.

Yet tragically, my course requires me to use all these windows/mac oriented programs, and so I unfortunately cannot really rely on a poorly configured Linux OS for my day-to-day work.

### "But Arch is the best distro ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è"
No it's not. 
Well, not for me anyway. Here's why:

- I want to dualboot, and doing so requires I turn off hibernate and fastboot - which stinks.
- Compatability with Adobe products is next to zero. (I study media)
- The partition I created can't even be used and instead it would overwrite my entire SSD.
- I cannot be bothered trying to fix my audio drivers half way through a lecture.


### Instead, I'm learning Python.
I've had a try at Lua and Html in the past but they suck (and I will not be trying assembly you freaks.)
