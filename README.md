# Info

**At first, I decided to work on Arch Linux for my laptop in my spare time.**

Yet tragically, my course requires me to use all these windows/mac oriented programs, and so I unfortunately cannot really rely on a poorly configured Linux OS for my day-to-day work.

**"But Arch is the best distro ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è"**
**No it's not.**

Well, not for me anyway since I need to dualboot since Windows & Adobe products are required on my university course. Also, I'd really hate for something to break (such as an audio driver) half way through something important.

**Instead, I'm learning Python.**

I've had a try at Lua and Html in the past but they suck (and I will not be trying assembly you freaks.)
