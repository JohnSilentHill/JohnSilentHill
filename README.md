# Hello

### I'm a university student and initially I decided to work on configuring Arch for my laptop in my spare time.

Because my course requires me to be able to use all these windows/mac oriented programs, I unfortunately cannot really rely on a shaky linux distro to handle my day-to-day schoolwork.

### Why?

- I want to dualboot, and doing so requires I turn off hibernate and fastboot - which stinks.
- Compatability with Adobe products is next to zero. (I study media)
- The partition I created can't even be used and instead it would overwrite my entire SSD.
- I cannot be bothered trying to fix my audio drivers half way through a lecture.


### Anyway, the reason I'm explaining this leads into the whole reason my Github account exists in the first place.

I decided to learn Python (or pick it back up after learning it briefly between ages 10-11)

I used to know a decent amount prior, but since then I've had a try at Lua and Html but ultimately I find the versatility of Python more appealing.

This account will therefore be dedicated to my progress in re-learning the language and expanding my skillset in my free time throughout my university life.
