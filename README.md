# Hello

### I decided to work on configuring Arch for my laptop in my spare time.

Tragically, my course requires me to be able to use all these windows/mac oriented programs, and so I unfortunately cannot really rely on a shaky linux distro to handle my day-to-day schoolwork.

### Why?

- I want to dualboot, and doing so requires I turn off hibernate and fastboot - which stinks.
- Compatability with Adobe products is next to zero. (I study media)
- The partition I created can't even be used and instead it would overwrite my entire SSD.
- I cannot be bothered trying to fix my audio drivers half way through a lecture.


### Instead, I'm learning python.
I've had a try at Lua and Html but they suck.
