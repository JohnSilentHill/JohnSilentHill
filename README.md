## About Me
------

This account was originally made to document my progress with an installation of Arch Linux on my laptop (and finding repositories for programs I could use on it.)
But since this isn't possible for many reasons, I'm instead learning Python, and frontend web development.

I may branch out to C# for UIs and apps, but for now I'm just trying to wrap my head around these two aspects.
