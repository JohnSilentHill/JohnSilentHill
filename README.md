## About Me
------

This account was originally made to document my progress with an installation of Arch Linux on my laptop (and finding repositories for programs I could use on it.)

I figured Arch is probably not for me since I need to dualboot - which would require me turning off fastboot and hibernate. Also, I'd really hate for something to break (such as an audio driver) half way through something important.

**Instead, I'm learning Python.**

I may branch out to C# or Javascript in the future, but for now I'm trying to wrap my head around one language at a time.
